# 🔁 Two Pointers Pattern – DSA Preparation

## 🚀 Overview

The **Two Pointers Pattern** is one of the most important and frequently asked patterns in Data Structures & Algorithms interviews — especially in product-based companies.

This pattern is commonly used for:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Sorted data problems
- In-place modifications with O(1) space complexity

I am starting my DSA journey by focusing on pattern-based problem solving (2 hours daily) and pushing solutions consistently to GitHub.

## 🎯 Why Two Pointers?

The Two Pointers technique helps:

- Reduce time complexity from **O(n²)** to **O(n)**
- Avoid unnecessary nested loops
- Solve problems in-place (constant extra space)
- Write optimized and clean logic
- Improve interview problem-solving efficiency

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

Instead of using nested loops, we use **two indices (pointers)** that move strategically across the data structure.

Depending on the problem, pointers can:

- Start from opposite ends
- Move in the same direction
- Expand and shrink a window

## 📚 Variations of Two Pointers

### 1️⃣ Opposite Direction (Left & Right)

**Used in:**
- Sorted Two Sum
- Valid Palindrome
- Container With Most Water
- Trapping Rain Water


### 2️⃣ Same Direction (Fast & Slow Pointer)

**Used in:**
- Remove Duplicates
- Move Zeroes
- Partition Array
- Linked List Cycle Detection (variation)

### 3️⃣ Sliding Window (Dynamic Two Pointers)

**Used in:**
- Subarray sum problems
- Longest substring without repeating characters
- Minimum window substring
- Maximum consecutive ones

## ✅ Problem Solved So Far

### Move Zeroes to End of Array

**Problem:**  
Given an integer array, move all `0`s to the end while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.

---

## 💡 Approach

- Use **Slow & Fast pointers**
- `fast` scans the array
- `slow` tracks the position to place the next non-zero element
- Swap elements when a non-zero is found

## ⏱ Time Complexity
O(n)

---

## 🧠 Space Complexity
O(1)
